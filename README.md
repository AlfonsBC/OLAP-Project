# OLAP-Project
This is an Online Analytical Processing Project about different currency exchange branches in Mexico.

## Description
It is required to analyze information corresponding to a chain of exchanges branches in Mexico, that sells and buys dollars. They receive information of the daily sales of dollars, the client's name and employee's name that make the deal with the client. However, there are promotions where you can sell the dollar cheaper to certain hours of the day. We want to know the following:
* Who is the employee that has sold the most dollars in the current year? (The same but broken down by month)
* What is the season of the year that we sell the least amount of dollars?
* What is the profit from the sale of dollars over the past year?
* Who was the customer that left the company the most profit?
* Who is the customer that buys the most amount of dollars?
* Which is the month most profitable in the last year? In the current year?
* What is the promotion that led the sold of the most amount of dollars?
